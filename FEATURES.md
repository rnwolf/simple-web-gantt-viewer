## üíæ Data Management

### File Operations

#### Save Functionality

- **Format**: JSON files containing all project data
- **Content Includes**:
  - All tasks with complete properties
  - All links/dependencies
  - All project markers
  - Comments
- **Browser Download**: Uses browser's native download mechanism
- **Filename Control**: User-specified filenames

#### Load Functionality

- **File Selection**: Browser file picker
- **Format Validation**: Ensures valid JSON structure
- **Complete Replacement**: Loads new project, replacing current data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid files

#### New Project

- **Clean Slate**: Clears all current project data
- **Template Data**: Loads a starter template generated relative to the current date (project starts soon). The visible timeline window is also set automatically so tasks are visible immediately.

### Data Persistence

#### ID Normalization Toggle

- Toolbar toggle: "Normalize IDs on save"
- When ON (default): Saves with numeric task IDs (1..N) and remapped link endpoints for readability/testing.
- When OFF: If any tasks have temporary `temp://` IDs, those IDs are preserved in saved tasks and links to avoid breaking relationships during editing.
- The project metadata includes `normalizedIds` to reflect the mode used when saving.

#### Date & Time Handling (critical)
- Tasks and markers are saved and loaded using local-naive datetimes for their date fields (no timezone suffix).
  - Example saved values: `2025-08-23T00:00:00` or `2025-08-23` for date-only fields.
  - No timezone conversion is applied on save: what you see in the UI is what is written to the JSON file.
- Loading rules:
  - If a date string ends with `Z` (UTC), the components are interpreted as local wall-clock time so that UI display matches the JSON value.
  - If the value is `YYYY-MM-DD`, it is parsed as a local date (midnight local) with no timezone shift.
  - If the value is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` (no `Z`), it is parsed as local time.
- Timeline viewport (metadata):
  - `timelineStart` and `timelineEnd` in metadata are stored as ISO strings (timezone-aware) to preserve the viewport window. These do not affect task date rendering; they only control the initial visible window when loading a project.

#### Timeline Viewport Persistence

- Saves timeline window into metadata as `timelineStart` and `timelineEnd`.
- On load, if metadata includes these values, the timeline is restored so the project is visible immediately.
- If absent, the app auto-computes a window from the tasks‚Äô min start and max end (with padding) or falls back to a sensible default around today.
- **Session State**: Maintains project state during browser session

## ‚ö° Advanced Features

### Resource View Export

- Export a resource-centric project file grouping tasks under summary tasks per resource ("Resource: {RESOURCE}").
- Each child task is duplicated under the resources it belongs to, with type set to "progress".
- Summary tasks‚Äô start/end/duration are recalculated based on children in the export.
- Links are omitted from the export for clarity.
- Important: Tasks without any assigned resource are excluded from the resource export.

TIP: Save the Resource view and open it in a second browser window. Arrange it side-by-side with the main project plan to visually compare plan vs capacity by resource.

### Zoom Configuration

## üöÄ Enhancements

- Specify Holidays in project plan to colour these as non-working days

## ‚ùì FAQ

- Why can‚Äôt I see my project tasks after loading a file?
  - The timeline window (Start/End) may not overlap your tasks. The app saves `timelineStart`/`timelineEnd` in metadata and restores them on load. If these are missing, it auto-derives a window from task dates. You can also set Timeline Start/End in the top bar.
